# Bonsai — The kanban board that not can but does

> Describe what you want. Your AI team builds it.

Bonsai is an open source, AI-powered kanban board where digital workers — researchers, designers, developers — autonomously execute your tickets. From research through live preview, the whole development cycle runs without you lifting a finger.

## What it does

1. **Build your team** — Create AI workers with custom names, skills, and personalities
2. **Write a ticket** — Plain English. One sentence or ten. Your team figures out the rest.
3. **Review and ship** — Watch the live preview. Approve what looks right. That's the job.

## Who it's for

- Solo founders who want to ship without hiring
- Developers who want to move faster on the boring stuff
- Small teams who want 10x output without 10x headcount
